# Tic Tac Toe - Haskell

**TODOs**:
- [x] Find formatters for `.cabal` and `.hs` files
- [x] Add some (prefferably Haskell based) file watcher to execute the formatters
- [x] Read-up on Haskell linting
- [x] Read-up on testing in Haskell
- [ ] Find how to control development dependencies in .cabal 

Notes:
- `stylish-haskell` feels like it's not doing much - not too suitable for learners without a faintest idea on how to style Haskell
